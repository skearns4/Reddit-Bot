This is a program that scans comments on www.reddit.com/r/all.
If the comment contains a certain string, the program will leave a comment on that comment, containing a the string of your choosing.

Reddit doesn't like users commenting too many times in a small window of time. If the program responds to too many comments in a certain amount of time, the program will crash.
Aside from this issue, as long as there is a constant internet connection and the Reddit site does not crash, the program should continue to run as written.
